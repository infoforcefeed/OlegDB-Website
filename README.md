This is the website for olegdb.org, built using a custom templating language and
static-site generator I am calling GRESHUNKEL. It is not to be taken seriously.
I mean it.

About
=====
GRESHUNKEL: A static site generator for the dead inside

This is a line-by-line static-site generator CUSTOM MADE for the olegdb.org
website. You run it, it builds everything in the templates directory with a
minimal and barely functional DSL, and out comes HTML. Gerbage!

Oh yeah, it also reads in the source code in the oleg header to build documen-
tation. Neat!

Installation
============
````
git submodule init
git submodule update
./build.py && ./deploy.sh
````

Man that was easy.

FAQ
===

## Why didnt you just use Hyde or something?

Wheres the fun in that?

## Okay, then why didn't you at least use Jinja2 or some sane templating language?

Wheres the fun in that?

## Well, uh, why is it so badly written?

I refuse to partake in outside projects, the community or any of the large
wealth of online resources that could've helped in building this. As such it
evolved organically and unstoppably.
