It's been a while since our [last report](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=never),
so I figured I'd write up a quick coverage of how much money OlegDB has made to
date.

```
OlegDB Proleg Subscribers: 0
Sticker sales to date: 9
```

As you can see the only thing currently making us any money is the sticker
sales, of which the margins are razor thin. Let's see the breakdown of the total
profit from the stickers:

Quite a few of those orders have just been me, so I'm not really sure how much
we've actually made. Clearly it's less than $10.00.

It's tough running a largely successful Open Source project, so I really
appreciate all of your support. I look forward to [another successful
quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumbleweed)
with all of you!
