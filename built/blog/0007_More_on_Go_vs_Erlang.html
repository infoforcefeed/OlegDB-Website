from <a href=https://olegdb.org/blog/0006_OlegDB_0.1.5_Release.html>Erlang to Go for the latest release.</a>
I also promised that I would go over in more detail why we switched and what the
benefit was, even if our lines added/removed was about the same.</p><p>The first thing I would like to clarify is that OlegDB is <strong>not</strong> primarily written in Go,
nor was it primarily written in Erlang. OlegDB is, and will always be, a giant C
hairball. I say hairball with the fondest conotations a neurotic developer can
conjure up. It seems many people were confused about this concept, so I will
repeat: We did not <strong>rewrite</strong> OlegDB in Go, we rewrote the communication layer
from Erlang to Go.</p><p>So to go over why we switched, I'll elaborate on the reasons I gave last time in more
detail:</p><p><ul><li>Bus-factor</li><li>The Port Driver</li><li>Easier to find Go contributors</li><li>Shipping a binary is infinitely easier than handling a VM</li><li>Unix signal handling</li></ul>
<h2>Bus Factor</h2></p><p>This is not Erlang's fault, it's completely mine. In the circles the OlegDB devs
run in, I push kind of a tyrannical <a href=http://qp-nodeps.shithouse.tv/>no dependencies</a>
policy which results in a lot of reinvented wheels. Because of this, I <a href=https://github.com/qpfiffer/mttp>wrote my
own HTTP server.</a> I had only
recently learned Erlang, and ignored a lot of best practices.</p><p>There are no OTP fundamentals, no dialyzer type checks, or tests. This made it kind of a mess, and
it doesn't help that everyone I talk to is scared to death of Erlang syntax for
some reason. So it was really just me maintaining this Erlang code, which made
it kind of a liability. Luckily <a href=http://friends.shithouse.tv/>we don't have any users so it's not really an issue.</a>
<h2>The Port Driver</h2>
Just <a href=https://github.com/infoforcefeed/OlegDB/blob/204779fa12334316e3c832a6881baa9b5cc43912/c_src/port_driver.c>look at this bad boy.</a>
Thats 620 lines of weird looking C used to talk to Erlang. Those 620 lines took
a <a href=http://qpfiffer.com/posts/2014-02-10-Erlang_port_drivers>long time to figure out,</a> and even
then half of the callbacks in the <a href=https://github.com/infoforcefeed/OlegDB/blob/204779fa12334316e3c832a6881baa9b5cc43912/c_src/port_driver.c#L592>ErlDrvEntry struct aren't used</a>.
Theres a lot of weird serialization that has to occur between the C and Erlang layers that isn't always
decipherable. Most people I talked to about the port driver just looked at the
code as one big black box of complexity. I guess this is probably my fault as
the completely fallible programmer.</p><p>I could've gone with Erlang <a href=http://www.erlang.org/doc/tutorial/nif.html>NIFs</a>
but those are designed for short, stateless, side-effectless computation which
is basically the opposite of a database. Port drivers remain the fastest way to
interface with foreign libraries.</p><p>The Go FFI stuff just <a href=https://github.com/infoforcefeed/OlegDB/blob/master/frontend/goleg/wrapper.go>makes more sense.</a>
You have a one-to-one mapping between C functions, types, calls, etc. that make
it really easy and readable.</p><p>I've used other FFI stuff, and Erlang's FFI solutions are definitely not my
favorite. I would love to know how others are using the port driver
interconnectivity in Erlang to see some good examples.
<h2>Go Contributors</h2></p><p>Maybe this is just the info-bubble I find myself in, but I have more Gopher
friends than Erlang friends. Since it's imperative and the syntax is mostly
familiar to people, I guess that makes it more open.</p><p>When your project is mayonnaise themed, you take what you can get.
<h2>Shipping a Binary</h2></p><p>I would rather ship a binary rather than beam files any day. I find it much easier to
ship plain old C/Go source code around than Erlang code that depends on the the
"ei.h" header, which apparently isn't even compiled <a href=https://gist.github.com/kyleterry/15b9cb23f3dfca4d8c12>for the right architecture
on OS X</a>. It takes
some real <a href=https://github.com/infoforcefeed/OlegDB/blob/d3b9f1ed5e8b60427f5285cc2790020c38684408/Makefile#L18>witches brew</a>
to properly find, include and link the headers. I could never get these to link
properly on OS X.
<h2>Unix Signal Handling</h2></p><p>This was really what killed me. Erlang has this idea that all programs are
running in the VM together, on a seperate plane of existance than userland. You
can't just send a SIGTERM to your program and send events based on that.
Instead you have to send signals to the running Erlang shell, which you tell
to <a href=http://erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html#id165878>ignore them</a>
with <code>+Bi</code>. Then Bash can catch them, send signals via a <a href=https://github.com/infoforcefeed/OlegDB/blob/204779fa12334316e3c832a6881baa9b5cc43912/run_server.sh#L10>new Erlang shell</a>
telling your program to halt and cleanup.</p><p>All of this makes it a nightmare to deal with, which is why some of the bigger
Erlang programs (<a href=http://www.rabbitmq.com/man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html>RabbitMQ</a>, <a href=http://www.actordb.com/docs-getstarted.html#run>ActorDB</a>)
use <code>ctl</code> scripts that do this sort of thing for you. If you want to have some
fun, peruse the CouchDB init script sometime.
<h2>Conclusions</h2></p><p>Erlang is great. I love it. I'd much rather create a project in Erlang than in
Go, but it's not <a href=https://github.com/infoforcefeed/OlegDB/graphs/contributors>all about me,</a> so I made some
concessions. The next time, I'll probably follow the
guidelines:</p><p><ul><li>Listen to the community. OTP, <code>erlang.mk</code>, Rebar, everything.</li><li>Erlang should be the only thing in the project. No weird dependencies, Erlang stands strong alone. See Riak, CouchDB, RabbitMQ.</li><li>Read <a href=http://www.erlang-in-anger.com/>Erlang in Anger</a> and then read it again to find out what not to do.</li></ul></p><p>I would really love to see people talking more about what they've done with the
port drivers, NIFs, BIFs, all that stuff. Spelunking through the <a href=https://github.com/mochi/mochiweb>Mochi webserver</a>
source code to figure out that acceptor pools are a thing was really fun! The
Erlang community really needs more visibility. For now we'll stick to Go and C.</p><p></p></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname = 'olegdbblog';(function() {var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);})();</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href="http://disqus.com" class="dsq-brlink">comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></div></div></div>
